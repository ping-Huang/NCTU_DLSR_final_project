An example of how to train different deep neural networks on the [CINIC-10]
dataset based on the [pytorch-cifar] repository.

## Development history
This example was constructed from kuangliu's excellent [pytorch-cifar] example.
Instead of utilizing the [CIFAR-10] dataset this example use [CINIC-10] which
is a drop in replacement to [CIFAR-10] which increases the difficulty of the
image classification task.

By changing the dataset we increase the amount of images from 60,000 to 270,000.
The images have the same size as in the CIFAR set and has equal train,
validation and test splits. The dataset is around 650 MB.

In addition to the dataset change this example also contains a number of other
changes including:

- Cosine annealing learning rate scheduler.
- Training time output.
- Dockerfile for simple dependency management.

## Run locally
Make sure that all nvidia drivers and CUDA runtimes are in place to be able to
run on the GPU. Install [PyTorch] matching your setup.

Download the dataset into the `./data/cinic-10` folder.

```
mkdir -p data/cinic-10
curl -L \
  https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10283/3192/CINIC-10.tar.gz \
  | tar xz -C data/cinic-10
```

Run the main.py file with your python environment where you installed [PyTorch].

```
python main.py
```

This creates a `checkpoint` folder in your workdir where the best performing
PyTorch model is saved. **Note** that it is overwritten on re-runs.

## Run with Nvidia Docker

To simply run a training session with the VGG16 neural network on nvidia-docker
simply run the following.

```
nvidia-docker run -it --rm --name cinic-10 antonfriberg/pytorch-cinic-10:latest
```

Currently there is a need for `-it` option in order to run the docker benchmark.

## Accuracy

This implementation achieves the following accuracy after training for 300
epochs on a single Nvidia GTX 1080TI.

## Learning rate adjustment
Instead of manually adjusting the learning rate a cosine annealing learning
rate scheduler is used.

## Samples
Below are samples randomly selected from CINIC-10 and from CIFAR-10 for comparison. It is clear that CINIC-10 is a more noisy dataset because the *Imagenet constituent samples were not vetted*.
